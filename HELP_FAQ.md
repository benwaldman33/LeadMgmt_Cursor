# LeadMgmt System Help & FAQ

## üÜï Latest Updates - January 2, 2025

### üö® **CRITICAL DATABASE CONFIGURATION INVESTIGATION: Data Loss and Setup Clarification**

**Problem**: User reported missing leads, campaigns, and workflows after switching to Docker setup, leading to extensive investigation into database configuration and data persistence issues.

**Root Cause Analysis**:
- **Database Evolution History**: System evolved through multiple database configurations:
  1. **Phase 1**: SQLite (`dev.db`) - Local development
  2. **Phase 2**: PostgreSQL (`leadscoring_dev`) - Docker setup
  3. **Phase 3**: PostgreSQL (`leadmgmt`) - Current configuration
- **Data Loss Event**: During transition from `leadscoring_dev` to `leadmgmt`, existing user data was lost
- **Configuration Confusion**: Multiple database configurations existed simultaneously, causing confusion about which database was active
- **Backup Analysis**: Backup files contained only schema definitions, not actual data, indicating data was already lost when backups were created

**Current Database Configuration (Verified)**:
- **Database Type**: PostgreSQL 15 (Alpine Linux) running in Docker
- **Database Name**: `leadmgmt`
- **Container**: `leadmgmt_cursor-postgres-1`
- **Access**: `localhost:5433` (mapped from container's 5432)
- **ORM**: Prisma configured for PostgreSQL
- **Data Status**: 6 users (from seeding), 0 leads/campaigns/workflows (data lost during transition)

**Migrations**:
- Prisma Migrate is the source of truth.
- Baseline migration exists at `backend/prisma/migrations/0001_init/migration.sql` (marked applied).
- Docker backend runs `prisma migrate deploy` at startup.

**Files Involved**:
- `docker-compose.yml` - PostgreSQL service configuration
- `backend/prisma/schema.prisma` - Database schema and provider configuration
- `backend/.env` - Database connection string
- `backup-leadmgmt.ps1` - Backup script (created after data loss issue)

**Resolution**:
- ‚úÖ Confirmed current database is PostgreSQL 15 in Docker
- ‚úÖ Verified Prisma is properly configured for PostgreSQL
- ‚úÖ Confirmed system is working correctly with current setup
- ‚úÖ Identified that user data was lost during database name transition
- ‚ùå Data recovery not possible (backups contain only schema, no data)

**Prevention Measures**:
- Updated all documentation to clarify database configuration
- Added comprehensive database setup guide
- Enhanced backup procedures to include data verification
- Added troubleshooting section for database issues

### üö® **CRITICAL INTEGRATION: Business Rules System & Database Configuration**

**Problem**: Comprehensive business rules system integration encountered multiple technical challenges including database connectivity issues, Docker networking problems, and frontend-backend communication issues that prevented the business rules functionality from working properly.

**Root Cause Analysis**:
- **Database Schema Migration**: New `RuleExecutionLog` table required for business rules audit trail
- **Docker Configuration**: Database name mismatch between Docker (`leadscoring_dev`) and Prisma (`leadmgmt`) configuration
- **Network Connectivity**: Docker networking issues prevented host machine from accessing database containers
- **Authentication Issues**: 500 errors on login attempts due to database connectivity problems
- **Frontend Integration**: "Create Rule" button non-functional due to backend communication failures

**Solutions Implemented**:
- **Business Rules Integration**: Complete integration across lead lifecycle events (creation, updates, scoring)
- **Database Configuration Fix**: Aligned Docker database name from `leadscoring_dev` to `leadmgmt`
- **Network Resolution**: Fixed port mapping (Docker: `postgres:5432`, Host: `localhost:5433`) and authentication credentials
- **Schema Migration Success**: Successfully applied `RuleExecutionLog` model to database
- **User Authentication**: Resolved login issues and created SUPER_ADMIN user (`admin@bbds.com` / `admin123`)
- **Frontend Enhancement**: Added comprehensive debug logging and improved error handling

**Status**: ‚úÖ **FULLY INTEGRATED** - Business rules system now fully functional with complete integration across lead lifecycle

**Business Rules Integration Points**:
```typescript
// Lead Creation - Rules evaluate automatically
await RuleExecutionService.executeRulesForLead(lead.id, 'created', {
  campaignId: lead.campaignId,
  industry: lead.industry,
  companyName: lead.companyName,
  domain: lead.domain
});

// Lead Updates - Rules evaluate on changes
await RuleExecutionService.executeRulesForLead(lead.id, 'updated', {
  previousStatus: oldLead?.status,
  newStatus: lead.status,
  assignedToChanged: oldLead?.assignedToId !== lead.assignedToId
});

// Pipeline Scoring - Rules evaluate after AI scoring
await RuleExecutionService.executeRulesForLead(lead.id, 'scored', {
  score: scoringResult.totalScore,
  confidence: scoringResult.confidence,
  campaignId: campaignId,
  pipelineJobId: jobId,
  industry: industry
});

// Manual Scoring - Rules evaluate after manual scoring
await RuleExecutionService.executeRulesForLead(leadId, 'scored', {
  totalScore: scoringResult.totalScore,
  confidence: scoringResult.confidence,
  scoringModelVersion: '1.0'
});
```

### ‚úÖ **RESOLVED: GitHub Push Protection & API Key Security**

**Problem**: GitHub was blocking all code pushes due to detected API keys in the repository, preventing deployment and collaboration.

**Root Cause**: Legacy utility scripts contained hardcoded API keys that were committed to the repository history.

**Solution**: 
- Removed API key files from entire Git history using `git filter-branch`
- Updated `.gitignore` to prevent future API key commits
- Verified existing API key management system is working correctly
- Preserved all development work while ensuring security

**Status**: ‚úÖ **FIXED** - Repository is now secure and pushes work normally

### üîê **API Key Security Best Practices**

**How API Keys Are Managed**:
- API keys are stored in environment variables (`.env` file)
- Database storage with AES-256-CBC encryption as fallback
- No hardcoded keys in application code
- Proper key rotation and management capabilities

**For Developers**:
- Never commit API keys to the repository
- Use environment variables for all sensitive data
- Test files should use placeholder values like "your-api-key-here"
- Utility scripts should be excluded from version control

## Previous Updates - September 28, 2025

### ‚úÖ **RESOLVED: AI Discovery Conversation ID Display Issue**

**Problem**: AI conversations were showing database IDs (like "cmg2upxjz000d6429mbhbf7y1") instead of readable industry names.

**Root Cause**: The conversation message endpoint was missing ID resolution logic that existed in other AI Discovery features.

**Solution**: 
- Added ID resolution to conversation messages endpoint
- AI now receives proper industry names like "Plant-Based Protein Manufacturing"
- Consistent behavior across all AI Discovery features

**Status**: ‚úÖ **FIXED** - Conversations now show proper industry names

### ‚úÖ **RESOLVED: Leads Page 400 Bad Request Error**

**Problem**: Leads page was failing to load with 400 Bad Request errors.

**Root Cause**: Frontend was sending filter data in wrong format (strings instead of arrays for status, strings instead of Date objects for dates).

**Solution**: 
- Updated frontend to send correct data types
- Enhanced filter validation and error handling
- Improved data type consistency

**Status**: ‚úÖ **FIXED** - Leads page now loads correctly

### ‚úÖ **ENHANCED: Scoring Model Industry Selection**

**Problem**: Users couldn't create scoring models for AI Discovery industries (like "Plant-Based Protein Manufacturing") due to limited 5-option dropdown.

**Solution**: 
- **Dynamic Industry List**: Now includes all AI Discovery industries
- **Custom Input**: Enter any industry name manually
- **Auto-Detection**: Automatically set industry from selected campaign
- **Visual Indicators**: Icons show data source (database vs hardcoded)

**Status**: ‚úÖ **ENHANCED** - Unlimited industry support for scoring models

### ‚úÖ **RESOLVED: Customer Search Returning 0 Results** (Previous Fix)

**Problem**: AI Discovery customer search was consistently returning 0 results despite having a robust AI search system.

**Root Cause**: Frontend was passing database IDs (UUIDs) to the backend, but the AI needed human-readable names. The AI was receiving prompts like "Search for customers in uuid-123 / uuid-456" instead of "Search for customers in Healthcare / Medical Devices".

**Solution**: 
- Backend now resolves industry and product vertical IDs to actual names before sending to AI
- Frontend displays proper names in all notifications and messages
- Enhanced notification system with better close buttons and accessibility

**Status**: ‚úÖ **FIXED** - Customer search now returns actual results

## üè¢ Business Rules System

### How do business rules work?
Business rules automate actions based on defined conditions. The system evaluates rules automatically during key lead lifecycle events:

1. **Lead Creation**: Rules evaluate when new leads are created
2. **Lead Updates**: Rules trigger on status changes or assignment modifications  
3. **Pipeline Processing**: Rules execute after AI scoring completion
4. **Manual Scoring**: Rules evaluate after manual lead scoring operations

### What actions can business rules perform?
**Assignment Actions**:
- **Target**: `user` or `team`
- **Value**: User ID or Team ID for assignment

**Status Change Actions**:
- **Target**: N/A (automatic)
- **Value**: New status (NEW, CONTACTED, QUALIFIED, etc.)

**Scoring Actions**:
- **Target**: N/A (automatic)
- **Value**: Score number for lead

**Notification Actions**:
- **Target**: Notification recipient
- **Value**: Notification message

**Enrichment Actions**:
- **Target**: Data field to enrich
- **Value**: Data source or enrichment instruction

### How do I create a business rule?

1. **Navigate to Business Rules**: Go to Admin ‚Üí Business Rules
2. **Create New Rule**: Click "Create Rule" button
3. **Define Conditions**: Set conditions for when the rule should trigger
4. **Configure Actions**: Define what actions will be performed
5. **Set Trigger Events**: Choose when rules should evaluate (created, updated, scored)
6. **Save & Activate**: Save the rule and it will automatically execute

**Rule Creation Example**:
```
Condition: Lead status equals "NEW" AND company name contains "Technology"
Actions: Assign to user "Sales Rep A", Set status to "CONTACTED"
Trigger: When lead is created or updated
```

### Troubleshooting Business Rules

**"Create Rule" button not working**:
1. **Check Database Connection**: Ensure PostgreSQL container is running (`docker-compose ps`)
2. **Verify Docker Configuration**: Check database name alignment in docker-compose.yml
