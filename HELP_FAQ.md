# LeadMgmt System Help & FAQ

## üÜï Latest Updates - January 2, 2025

### ‚úÖ **RESOLVED: GitHub Push Protection & API Key Security**

**Problem**: GitHub was blocking all code pushes due to detected API keys in the repository, preventing deployment and collaboration.

**Root Cause**: Legacy utility scripts contained hardcoded API keys that were committed to the repository history.

**Solution**: 
- Removed API key files from entire Git history using `git filter-branch`
- Updated `.gitignore` to prevent future API key commits
- Verified existing API key management system is working correctly
- Preserved all development work while ensuring security

**Status**: ‚úÖ **FIXED** - Repository is now secure and pushes work normally

### üîê **API Key Security Best Practices**

**How API Keys Are Managed**:
- API keys are stored in environment variables (`.env` file)
- Database storage with AES-256-CBC encryption as fallback
- No hardcoded keys in application code
- Proper key rotation and management capabilities

**For Developers**:
- Never commit API keys to the repository
- Use environment variables for all sensitive data
- Test files should use placeholder values like "your-api-key-here"
- Utility scripts should be excluded from version control

## Previous Updates - September 28, 2025

### ‚úÖ **RESOLVED: AI Discovery Conversation ID Display Issue**

**Problem**: AI conversations were showing database IDs (like "cmg2upxjz000d6429mbhbf7y1") instead of readable industry names.

**Root Cause**: The conversation message endpoint was missing ID resolution logic that existed in other AI Discovery features.

**Solution**: 
- Added ID resolution to conversation messages endpoint
- AI now receives proper industry names like "Plant-Based Protein Manufacturing"
- Consistent behavior across all AI Discovery features

**Status**: ‚úÖ **FIXED** - Conversations now show proper industry names

### ‚úÖ **RESOLVED: Leads Page 400 Bad Request Error**

**Problem**: Leads page was failing to load with 400 Bad Request errors.

**Root Cause**: Frontend was sending filter data in wrong format (strings instead of arrays for status, strings instead of Date objects for dates).

**Solution**: 
- Updated frontend to send correct data types
- Enhanced filter validation and error handling
- Improved data type consistency

**Status**: ‚úÖ **FIXED** - Leads page now loads correctly

### ‚úÖ **ENHANCED: Scoring Model Industry Selection**

**Problem**: Users couldn't create scoring models for AI Discovery industries (like "Plant-Based Protein Manufacturing") due to limited 5-option dropdown.

**Solution**: 
- **Dynamic Industry List**: Now includes all AI Discovery industries
- **Custom Input**: Enter any industry name manually
- **Auto-Detection**: Automatically set industry from selected campaign
- **Visual Indicators**: Icons show data source (database vs hardcoded)

**Status**: ‚úÖ **ENHANCED** - Unlimited industry support for scoring models

### ‚úÖ **RESOLVED: Customer Search Returning 0 Results** (Previous Fix)

**Problem**: AI Discovery customer search was consistently returning 0 results despite having a robust AI search system.

**Root Cause**: Frontend was passing database IDs (UUIDs) to the backend, but the AI needed human-readable names. The AI was receiving prompts like "Search for customers in uuid-123 / uuid-456" instead of "Search for customers in Healthcare / Medical Devices".

**Solution**: 
- Backend now resolves industry and product vertical IDs to actual names before sending to AI
- Frontend displays proper names in all notifications and messages
- Enhanced notification system with better close buttons and accessibility

**Status**: ‚úÖ **FIXED** - Customer search now returns actual results
