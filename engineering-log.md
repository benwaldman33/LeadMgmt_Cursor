### AI Discovery Feature Implementation
- **Area:** AI-powered lead discovery, industry analysis, customer search, pipeline integration
- **Changes Made:**
  - Implemented complete AI Discovery system with industry selection and product vertical discovery
  - Created `AIDiscoveryService` with mock data for 6 industries and their product verticals
  - Built comprehensive search functionality with industry-specific customer types
  - Added AI conversation interface for guided discovery sessions
  - Integrated with pipeline system for seamless workflow from discovery to enrichment
  - Enhanced search constraints with geography filtering and result limits
  - Implemented real-time WebSocket notifications for discovery activities
- **Technical Decisions:**
  - Mock data structure with realistic industry/vertical/customer type hierarchies
  - Customer types extracted from selected product verticals for accurate search
  - Search results filtered by geography and result limits for scalability
  - Pipeline integration sends discovered URLs directly to enrichment workflow
  - WebSocket notifications track user activity throughout discovery process
- **Architecture:**
  - Industry → Product Vertical → Customer Types → Search → Pipeline workflow
  - Mock data provides realistic examples for dental/CBCT, dental/lasers, construction
  - Search results include relevance scores, locations, and company types
  - Pipeline integration maintains context (industry, source) for downstream processing
- **Benefits:**
  - Complete AI-guided lead discovery workflow
  - Industry-specific insights and customer targeting
  - Seamless integration with existing pipeline system
  - Scalable architecture for real web search integration
- **Files Created/Modified:**
  - `backend/src/services/aiDiscoveryService.ts` (new)
  - `backend/src/routes/aiDiscovery.ts` (new)
  - `frontend/src/services/aiDiscoveryService.ts` (new)
  - `frontend/src/pages/AIDiscoveryPage.tsx` (new)
  - `frontend/src/App.tsx` (AI Discovery routing)
  - `frontend/src/components/DashboardLayout.tsx` (AI Discovery navigation)

### Search Functionality Fix
- **Area:** AI Discovery search, customer type handling, mock data enhancement
- **Changes Made:**
  - Fixed search functionality to properly extract customer types from selected product verticals
  - Enhanced mock data with industry-specific results for dental/CBCT, dental/lasers, and construction
  - Added comprehensive debugging logs to frontend search function
  - Improved search results filtering and display
- **Technical Decisions:**
  - Customer types now sourced from selected product vertical instead of empty discovery session
  - Mock data structured to match real industry/vertical combinations
  - Debugging logs provide visibility into search process for development
  - Search results include realistic company data with locations and descriptions
- **Benefits:**
  - Search now returns appropriate results based on industry/vertical selection
  - Better user experience with realistic mock data
  - Improved debugging capabilities for development
  - Foundation ready for real web search integration

### Automated Pipeline System Implementation
- **Area:** Pipeline service, WebSocket notifications, database schema, UI components
- **Changes Made:**
  - Implemented `PipelineService` with complete workflow automation
  - Added real-time WebSocket notifications for pipeline progress
  - Created comprehensive UI components: `PipelineForm`, `PipelinePage`, `RawDataViewer`
  - Enhanced database schema to support pipeline job tracking
  - Added pipeline navigation and routing integration
- **Technical Decisions:**
  - Pipeline runs asynchronously with real-time progress updates
  - WebSocket notifications for start, progress, completion, and failure states
  - URL validation with automatic protocol addition (https://)
  - Campaign scoring model validation before pipeline execution
  - Comprehensive error handling with detailed error messages
  - Raw data storage with collapsible UI sections for better UX
- **Architecture:**
  - Pipeline service orchestrates: URL import → Web scraping → Content analysis → Lead scoring
  - Each step is tracked and reported via WebSocket
  - Failed URLs are logged but don't stop the entire pipeline
  - Results include success/failure status, scores, and qualification status
- **Benefits:**
  - Complete automation of lead generation workflow
  - Real-time visibility into processing progress
  - Comprehensive data extraction and storage
  - Scalable architecture for batch processing
- **Files Created/Modified:**
  - `backend/src/services/pipelineService.ts` (new)
  - `backend/src/routes/leads.ts` (pipeline endpoints)
  - `backend/src/services/websocketService.ts` (pipeline notifications)
  - `frontend/src/components/PipelineForm.tsx` (new)
  - `frontend/src/pages/PipelinePage.tsx` (new)
  - `frontend/src/components/RawDataViewer.tsx` (new)
  - `frontend/src/pages/LeadDetailPage.tsx` (raw data integration)
  - `frontend/src/App.tsx` (pipeline routing)
  - `frontend/src/components/DashboardLayout.tsx` (pipeline navigation)

### Enhanced Web Scraping Data Storage
- **Area:** Database schema, lead enrichment, scoring service
- **Changes Made:**
  - Enhanced `LeadEnrichment` model with comprehensive scraped data storage
  - Added fields: `scrapedContent`, `pageTitle`, `pageDescription`, `pageKeywords`, `pageLanguage`, `lastModified`, `companyName`, `services`, `certifications`, `contactEmail`, `contactPhone`, `contactAddress`, `processingTime`, `scrapingSuccess`, `scrapingError`
  - Updated lead enrichment endpoints to store all scraped data
  - Enhanced scoring service to use full scraped content for better accuracy
  - Created new API endpoint `/api/leads/:id/enrichment` for detailed enrichment data
  - Built `EnrichmentDetails` component for comprehensive data visualization
- **Technical Decisions:**
  - Content truncated to 10KB for database storage efficiency
  - JSON fields used for arrays (technologies, services, certifications, keywords)
  - Processing metadata stored for quality assessment
  - Contact information extracted and stored separately from Contact model
- **Benefits:**
  - Significantly improved lead scoring accuracy using full content
  - Rich lead profiles with technology stack and service information
  - Automatic contact discovery from websites
  - Better data quality assessment through processing metadata
- **Migration:** Applied migration `20250711015906_enhance_lead_enrichment_storage`

### Notification ID Uniqueness (frontend/src/contexts/NotificationContext.tsx)
- Notification IDs for toasts are generated using `crypto.randomUUID()` if available, or a fallback using `Date.now()` and a random string.
- This approach is highly robust, but not mathematically guaranteed to be collision-free.
- **NOTE:** If absolute uniqueness is ever required, revisit this logic to add a collision check or use a more robust ID generation strategy.
