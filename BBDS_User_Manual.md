## Business Rules

> 📖 **For a complete tutorial with step-by-step examples, see [BUSINESS_RULES_TUTORIAL.md](./BUSINESS_RULES_TUTORIAL.md)**

### Overview

Business Rules automate lead management decisions throughout the lead lifecycle. Rules execute automatically when leads are created, updated, scored, or enriched, enabling sophisticated workflows without manual intervention.

### Rule Types

The system supports five distinct rule types:

1. **Assignment Rules** - Automatically assign leads to users or teams based on criteria
   - Territory-based routing
   - Skill-based assignment
   - Round-robin distribution
   - Workload balancing

2. **Scoring Rules** - Dynamically adjust lead scores
   - Bonus points for key attributes
   - Industry-specific adjustments
   - Campaign-based scoring
   - Time-based modifications

3. **Notification Rules** - Trigger alerts and notifications
   - High-value lead alerts
   - SLA breach warnings
   - Team notifications
   - Executive escalations

4. **Status Change Rules** - Automatically update lead status
   - Auto-qualification workflows
   - Nurture campaign triggers
   - Disqualification rules
   - Conversion tracking

5. **Enrichment Rules** - Schedule data enrichment
   - High-priority lead enrichment
   - Missing data completion
   - Technology detection
   - Company research

### Rule Configuration

#### Basic Settings
- **Name**: Descriptive rule identifier
- **Description**: Purpose and logic explanation
- **Type**: One of the five rule types above
- **Priority**: Execution order (0-100, higher = first)
- **Active Status**: Enable/disable without deletion

#### Conditions
Define when rules execute using:
- **Fields**: score, status, industry, companyName, domain, companySize, revenue, confidence, and more
- **Operators**: equals, not_equals, greater_than, less_than, contains, in, not_in
- **Logical Operators**: AND/OR for combining multiple conditions
- **Context Data**: Access trigger-specific data (e.g., previous status, score changes)

Example condition:
```
IF score > 80 AND industry = "dental" AND status = "new"
```

#### Actions
Define what happens when conditions match:
- **Assignment**: Assign to specific user or team
- **Scoring**: Update lead score
- **Notification**: Send email/SMS alerts with custom recipients
- **Status Change**: Update to new status
- **Enrichment**: Trigger data enrichment with specific sources

### Rule Execution

#### Trigger Events
Rules execute automatically at four lifecycle points:

| Event | Description | Example Rules |
|-------|-------------|---------------|
| `created` | New lead created | Assignment, initial notifications |
| `updated` | Lead data modified | Status change, re-assignment |
| `scored` | AI scoring completed | Score-based routing, alerts |
| `enriched` | Enrichment data added | Update assignments, trigger workflows |

#### Execution Order
1. Rules execute in **priority order** (highest first)
2. Multiple rules can execute for single event
3. Each rule runs independently
4. Actions apply immediately
5. Execution logged for audit trail

### Rule Management

#### Creating Rules
1. Navigate to **Business Rules** → **Create Rule**
2. Configure basic information
3. Add conditions (minimum 1 required)
4. Add actions (minimum 1 required)
5. Test with sample data
6. Save and activate

#### Testing Rules
- **Test Endpoint**: Validate logic with sample data before activation
- **Dry Run Mode**: See what would happen without applying changes
- **Execution Logs**: Review historical executions
- **Debug Mode**: Detailed condition evaluation

#### Monitoring
- **Execution Logs**: Complete audit trail per lead
- **Statistics Dashboard**: Success rates, execution counts
- **Performance Metrics**: Execution time, error rates
- **Impact Analysis**: Lead conversion effects

### Best Practices

#### Priority Guidelines
- **90-100**: Critical operations, VIP handling
- **70-89**: Important assignments, urgent alerts
- **50-69**: Standard operations (default)
- **30-49**: Secondary actions
- **10-29**: Background tasks

#### Condition Design
- ✅ Be specific to avoid unintended executions
- ✅ Use status checks to prevent re-firing
- ✅ Test with edge cases (nulls, empty strings)
- ✅ Document complex logic clearly

#### Action Safety
- ⚠️ Avoid circular rule chains
- ⚠️ Validate user/team IDs before use
- ⚠️ Limit notification volume
- ⚠️ Consider performance impact

#### Maintenance
- Review rules monthly for relevance
- Monitor execution logs for failures
- Update as business requirements change
- Deactivate rather than delete for audit trail

### Common Use Cases

1. **Territory-Based Assignment**: Route leads by geography/industry
2. **VIP Lead Detection**: Alert management for high-value opportunities
3. **Auto-Qualification**: Move high-scoring leads to qualified status
4. **Lead Nurture**: Route low-score leads to nurture campaigns
5. **Data Quality**: Trigger enrichment for incomplete leads

### Rule Templates

Pre-built templates available:
- High-Value Lead Assignment
- Industry-Specific Routing
- Score-Based Qualification
- SLA Breach Notifications
- Data Completion Workflows

### API Access

Rules can be managed programmatically:

- `PUT /api/business-rules/:id` - Update rule
- `DELETE /api/business-rules/:id` - Delete rule

- **Enrichment Rules**: Trigger data enrichment

**Q: How do I test a business rule?**
A: Use the "Test Rule" feature to validate logic with sample data. Click the test button on any rule, provide sample lead data (score, industry, status, etc.), and the system will show whether conditions match and what actions would execute—without actually modifying any leads.

**Q: When do business rules execute?**
A: Rules execute automatically at four trigger points: when a lead is `created`, `updated`, `scored` (after AI scoring), or `enriched` (after enrichment data is added). Rules execute in priority order (highest priority first).

**Q: Can multiple rules execute for the same lead?**
A: Yes! Multiple rules can execute for a single lead event. They execute in priority order (90-100 = highest, 10-29 = lowest) and run independently of each other.

**Q: How do I prevent rules from conflicting?**
A: Use priorities to control execution order, make conditions more specific to avoid unintended matches, and use status checks in conditions to prevent rules from re-firing on the same lead.

**Q: Can I see rule execution history?**
A: Yes! Navigate to any lead's detail page and check the Activity Log to see which rules executed, when they ran, whether they succeeded, and what actions were applied. System administrators can also view execution statistics in the Business Rules dashboard.

**Q: What permissions do I need to create rules?**
A: Creating, editing, and deleting business rules requires **SUPER_ADMIN** or **ANALYST** role. All users can view rules and execution logs for leads they have access to.
