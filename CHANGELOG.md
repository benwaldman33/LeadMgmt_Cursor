### Fixed
- **Search Terms Input Field**: Fixed space key not working in Create/Edit Scoring Model pages
  - Root cause: React state update cycle was interfering with keyboard input on search terms field
  - Solution: Separated display string (`searchTermsInput`) from parsed data (`searchTerms`) to prevent input interference
  - Input fields now work naturally without keystroke blocking for multi-word phrases
  - Maintains full backend compatibility with parsed search terms array
  - Enhanced user experience for entering complex search terms like "cone beam computed tomography"

- **Claude API Integration**: Fixed critical Claude API configuration and authentication issues
  - Fixed `getDecryptedConfig()` function to properly decrypt API keys instead of returning `[ENCRYPTED]`
  - Updated Claude model from deprecated `claude-3-sonnet-20240229` to current `claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022`
  - Implemented smart API key handling for both encrypted and plain text storage formats
  - Added fallback decryption logic for API keys stored directly without encryption formatting
  - Fixed TypeScript compilation errors preventing build: admin routes user ID access, Apify service type issues, scoring service missing method
  - Verified successful Claude API connection with 1-second response times
  - All AI scoring features now fully functional with Claude integration

- **Self-Prompting AI Analysis**: Enhanced AI Discovery with autonomous analytical capabilities
  - Modified `generateCustomerInsights()` to use self-prompting analysis instead of static information
  - Added `buildSelfPromptingAnalysisPrompt()` that makes AI ask itself analytical questions
  - Enhanced `buildConversationPrompt()` to include follow-up questions in responses
  - Added `generateFollowUpAnalysis()` for deeper analysis on follow-up questions
  - AI now automatically prompts itself with key questions about customer landscape
  - Responses include both answers and follow-up questions to continue analysis
  - Added keyword detection for triggering additional self-prompting analysis
  - AI conducts thorough market analysis by asking itself questions and analyzing answers

- **Claude-Powered Product Vertical Discovery**: Enhanced AI Discovery with dynamic vertical discovery
  - Modified `getProductVerticals()` to use Claude AI for real-time industry analysis
  - Added `buildProductVerticalDiscoveryPrompt()` for intelligent Claude API calls
  - Implemented `parseClaudeProductVerticals()` to parse Claude's JSON responses
  - Enhanced frontend with AI discovery notifications and loading states
  - Added fallback to mock data if Claude API fails for reliability
  - Improved UI to show Claude AI analysis progress with spinner and status messages
  - Maintains backward compatibility with existing mock data structure
  - Dynamic discovery works for any industry Claude can analyze (not limited to predefined ones)
  - Real-time market intelligence with current trends and opportunities

- **AI Discovery Feature**: Complete AI-powered lead discovery system
  - Implemented industry selection with 6 major industries (Dental, Construction, Manufacturing, Healthcare, Food & Beverage, Distribution)
  - Added product vertical discovery with industry-specific verticals and customer types
  - Built comprehensive search functionality with mock data for dental/CBCT, dental/lasers, and construction
  - Created AI conversation interface for guided discovery sessions
  - Added pipeline integration to send discovered customers to enrichment workflow
  - Enhanced search constraints with geography and result limits
  - Implemented real-time WebSocket notifications for discovery activities
  - Fixed search functionality to properly use customer types from selected product verticals
  - Added comprehensive debugging and error handling throughout the discovery flow

- Project initialized with CHANGELOG.md and engineering-log.md for better documentation and tracking.
- See engineering-log.md for technical notes and areas to revisit.
