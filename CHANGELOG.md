## Process Flow Documentation

### AI Discovery Customer Search Flow

#### 1. Frontend Initiation
1. User selects an industry from discovered industries
2. System loads product verticals for the selected industry
3. User selects a product vertical
4. User clicks "Search for Customers" button

#### 2. Frontend Processing
1. `handleSearchCustomers()` function extracts:
   - Industry ID and resolves to name
   - Product vertical ID and resolves to name
   - Customer types from selected vertical
   - Search constraints (geography, max results, etc.)

2. Shows user-friendly notification with proper names:
   - "AI is searching for customers in the Healthcare industry for Medical Devices..."

#### 3. Backend API Processing
1. `/api/ai-discovery/search-customers` endpoint receives request
2. **ID Resolution Phase**:
   - Queries database to resolve industry ID to name
   - Queries database to resolve product vertical ID to name
   - Logs resolution results for debugging
   - Falls back to original values if resolution fails

3. **AI Search Phase**:
   - Calls `AIDiscoveryService.searchForCustomers()` with resolved names
   - AI receives proper prompts like "Search for customers in Healthcare / Medical Devices"
   - Implements multi-tier search strategy:
     - Primary search with specific criteria
     - Broader search if primary fails
     - Industry-specific search as final fallback

4. **Response Processing**:
   - Parses AI response into structured customer results
   - Sends WebSocket notification with proper names
   - Returns results to frontend

#### 4. Frontend Display
1. Receives search results and displays them
2. Shows success notification with proper names
3. User can view customer details and visit company websites
4. Option to process URLs for lead generation

### Key Architectural Decisions

#### ID Resolution Strategy
- **Problem**: Frontend passes database IDs, but AI needs human-readable names
- **Solution**: Backend resolves IDs to names before AI processing
- **Benefits**: 
  - AI receives meaningful prompts
  - Users see proper names in notifications
  - Maintains database integrity with IDs
  - Graceful fallback if resolution fails

#### Multi-Tier AI Search Strategy
- **Primary Search**: Specific criteria with exact industry/product vertical match
- **Broader Search**: Expanded criteria if primary search returns no results
- **Industry-Specific Search**: Focus on industry characteristics if broader search fails
- **Benefits**: Maximizes chances of finding relevant customers

#### Notification System Enhancement
- **Problem**: Some notifications couldn't be closed and showed IDs instead of names
- **Solution**: 
  - Enhanced Toast component with better positioning
  - Improved RealTimeNotifications with proper type mapping
  - Added accessibility features and better styling
  - Resolved names displayed in all user-facing content

### Database Schema Relationships

```
Industry (id, name, description, ...)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ProductVertical (id, name, industryId, ...)
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ CustomerType (id, name, productVerticalId, ...)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ OperationServiceMapping (operation, serviceId, priority, ...)
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ServiceProvider (id, name, type, config, ...)
```

### Error Handling Strategy

1. **ID Resolution Errors**: Graceful fallback to original values
2. **AI Engine Failures**: Multi-tier search with different strategies
3. **Database Connection Issues**: Comprehensive logging and user feedback
4. **Frontend State Errors**: Proper error boundaries and user notifications

### Performance Considerations

1. **Database Queries**: Optimized ID resolution with selective field queries
2. **AI API Calls**: Implemented retry logic and fallback strategies
3. **Frontend State**: Efficient state management and minimal re-renders
4. **Caching**: Strategic caching of resolved names and AI responses

This architecture ensures robust customer discovery while maintaining excellent user experience and system reliability.
