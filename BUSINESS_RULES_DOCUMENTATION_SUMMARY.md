## Verification Against Codebase

All documentation verified against actual implementation:

### Backend Implementation
- ✅ `backend/src/routes/businessRules.ts` - API routes
- ✅ `backend/src/services/businessRuleService.ts` - Core rule logic

- ✅ `backend/prisma/schema.prisma` - Database models

### Frontend Implementation  
- ✅ `frontend/src/pages/CreateBusinessRulePage.tsx` - UI components
- ✅ `frontend/src/services/businessRuleService.ts` - Frontend service

### Key Findings Documented
1. **Five Rule Types**: assignment, scoring, notification, status_change, enrichment ✅
2. **Seven Operators**: equals, not_equals, greater_than, less_than, contains, in, not_in ✅
3. **Four Trigger Events**: created, updated, scored, enriched ✅
4. **Priority System**: 0-100 scale, higher = first execution ✅
5. **Logical Operators**: AND/OR for condition chaining ✅
6. **Execution Logging**: RuleExecutionLog table for audit trail ✅
